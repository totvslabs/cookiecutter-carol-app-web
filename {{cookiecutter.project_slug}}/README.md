Running the application locally
---

It has no special steps to run it locally. In case you don't have the right tools to start a simple web server, you can try the one Python provides:

Python 3:

```
python3 -m http.server
```

Python 2:

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```



Running the application in Carol
---

It is recommended to upload the minified application to Carol. If you are using Angular, we strongly recommend sending only the production version (`ng build`).


Additional information
---

We provide an Angular sample application using T-Faces: https://github.com/totvslabs/carolapp-std-tface.
